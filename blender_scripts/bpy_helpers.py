"""
Reusable Blender (bpy) helpers for procedurally building Roblox game props and characters.

Copy this file next to your generation scripts (or keep one shared copy per project) and
import from it, instead of re-deriving basic geometry/material code in every script — reusing
the same building blocks is a big part of how generated objects end up looking consistent with
each other.

Two families of geometry helpers, pick per-object rather than defaulting to one:

- Primitives (create_box, create_cylinder, create_sphere) + boolean_combine — good for
  hard-surface objects: furniture, containers, weapons, machinery. Distinct flat/angular parts
  that plausibly bolt together.
- skin_mesh_from_edges, create_mesh_from_data, create_bezier_curve, add_subsurf — good for
  organic shapes: creatures, characters, plants, anything that should read as one continuous
  rounded form rather than a collection of parts. Stacking primitives for these tends to
  produce a visibly segmented "pile of shapes" look — reach for these instead.

Plus finishing helpers used regardless of which family built the geometry:
join_objects (merge every piece into one final Part, keeping per-piece materials as separate
slots), create_armature/bind_mesh_to_armature (a basic animation-ready rig for characters/
creatures), and render_preview (render a quick image to actually look at before deciding a
result is done, rather than judging it from the code alone).

Everything here is meant to be called from a script run as:
    blender --background --python your_script.py
